# javascript-masterclass

## Summer of Tech bootcamp

During the masterclass we're going to be working on building a small application using Node, Express, Sockets.io, React and Chart.js

You will need to have at least a basic level of JavaScript in order to be able to participate - if you're not sure if you do, then work through [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) to get up to speed first.

## Before the masterclass

If you'd like to follow along during the masterclass, there are a few things you'll need to set up in advance.

### Clone this repository

If you have your own github account already, you might prefer to fork this repository and clone that instead. If you don't just run the following commands on a terminal or command line interface:

    git clone https://github.com/jenofdoom/javascript-masterclass.git
    cd javascript-masterclass

If you don't already have git installed on your machine, the above won't work: you can either [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or just grab the zip file of this project and unzip it.

### Install node, npm and bower

First, we need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and its package manager, npm.

[Ubuntu/Debian/Mint instructions](https://rtcamp.com/tutorials/nodejs/node-js-npm-install-ubuntu/)

Once that's done, we can install [Bower](http://bower.io/) using npm. We want to install Bower globally (for more than just this project), so we use a `-g` flag. Note that if you have difficulty installing Bower it might be because you need to install it with administrator permissions - rerun the command with `sudo` in front.

    npm install -g bower

### Install our dependencies

Now we've got npm and bower set up, we can use the `package.json` and `bower.json` files that are already set up in the project to install all the other packages we are going to be using. Have a look at those two files to see what things we are grabbing.

Run the following two commands (from inside the `javascript-masterclass` directory):

    npm install
    bower install

And you're all set! We'll pick up from this point.
